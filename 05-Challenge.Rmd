Grocery items and quantities purchased. Each observation represents a single basket of goods that were purchased together.
Problem type: unsupervised basket analysis
response variable: NA
features: 42
observations: 2,000
objective: use attributes of each basket to identify common groupings of items purchased together.
access: available on the companion website for this book
